# Woocommerce Custom Product Options
The WooCommerce-based plugin has been developed to showcase custom product input values on the frontend product details page. When a product is added to the cart, these values are passed to various areas such as the cart, backend order, and the user's "My Account" page.

The plugin offers the capability to add fields on the product editing page. When you click on the "Add Field" button, a new form will appear. You'll need to select the field type, provide a field name, and set a default value or select options. Upon saving the product, the custom product field input will automatically appear on the frontend product details page.
